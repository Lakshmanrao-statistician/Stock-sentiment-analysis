Problem statement: create Machine Learning Algorthem using Stock Sentiment Analysis using News Headlines
                    It's not prediction problem, showing stock is incresing or decreasing.
                    It's an example of review/feedback problem
                    
About of data: 25 features are described as top1, top2.....top25 (Headlines) & Label 
'0' represent negative impact '1' represent positive impact.


NLP Natural Language Process

Text preprocessing (it's a text analysis)

Reading data need to encoding = "ISO-8859-1" because in data so many special characters.

All sentencess converted into vectors : That is combining all independent variables into one category 
so, that it's easy to convert into vector

CountVectorizer

 

machine learning pipeline also we can impliment.
